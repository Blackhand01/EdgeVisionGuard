(00:00) this is an Arduino Uno or is it it does not say Arduino the color looks quite different and what is R3 is it a fake was I duped well let's begin from the start hi I'm Tommy Bianco and today I'll tell you all about Arduino development boards Arduino Is An Open Source Hardware and software company that creates prototyping solutions for education hobbyists and Industry it is open source which means that anyone including you can download their latest documentation and build your own Arduino this is why you can find arduinos made
(00:44) by different manufacturers including some rather peculiar options except that you can't use the name Arduino it's a brand which resulted in a number of creative naming Solutions this off-brand boards follow the original Arduino Blueprints and they utilize similar if not identical Hardware which means that they only differ in the manufacturing quality or the lack of thereof external manufacturers aside Arduino themselves have created several dozens of different boards so what port do you pick for your next specific
(01:21) project leads let me walk you through the options and share some relevant project examples so you can make your choice between Uno mego Nano or maybe even maker Arduino creators themselves split their impressive portfolio into three families classic Nano and maker Arduino classic includes the iconic Arduino Uno R3 on this board means that it is the third revision of the classic each iteration providing some improvements of the design start report a perfectly balanced and affordable solution to help you build your first few projects
(02:00) Arduino Uno Wi-Fi as the name suggests is an UNO R3 upgrade with embedded Wi-Fi and Bluetooth currently available in its second revision it is a great solution if you want to make a connected project like an RGB display you can control from a smartphone just a few days ago aridulino unveiled its Uno R4 which spots a new microcontroller and offers a 16-fold increase in memory this comes really handy if you have a program with many variables like animations in my Chachi PT video which quickly take up all of your program
(02:37) memory Uno R4 comes in two variants Minima and Wi-Fi which act as successes to Uno R3 and Uno Wi-Fi ref2 the flagship Legend Arduino Uno Wi-Fi offers an onboard 12x8 LED Matrix convenient alternative if you don't have a display module like one of these guys or you just don't want the fast of dealing with the wires Arduino Leonardo looks like a Nuno but features a processor with a built-in USB communication eliminating the need for a secondary processor a little chip right here on our little Uno this allows Leonardo to appear to your computer as a
(03:21) mouse and keyboard Arduino zero also looks like an UNO but features a different processor that supports 32-bit application development for more demanding projects it also features a low power mode and an embedded debugger which allows you to use Admiral studio for well Advanced debugging early in the mega looks nothing like Arduino Uno this larger Port offers considerably more digital and analog pins making it suitable for larger projects with many modules and peripherals Arduino takes Mega floater by using a quicker 32-bit core
(03:59) microcontroller with more memory similar to Arduino zero making it a better fit for larger and more demanding projects Arduino Giga is even more ambitious with a dual core 32-bit microcontroller onboard Wi-Fi Bluetooth r2com connector and many other embedded features the only thing more impressive than Arduino gigas Hardware is its price tag good thing it's an absolute Overkill and most of my projects run on Good Old Uno R3 last but not least Arduino micro is similar to Leonardo or Uno R3 but it offers a much smaller spatial footprint
(04:40) for more compact projects Arduino Nano acts as a base model for the second Arduino board family Nano family just like Arduino Uno R3 in the classic division Nano looks almost identical to Arduino micro also coming in a small form factor just a few millimeters shorter than micro it spots a slightly different microcontroller different pin out and offers way more versions which also look extremely similar Arduino Nano every offers a noticeably better processor and swaps mini USB to micro USB all while coming at how the price of the original
(05:20) Nano choosing between these two really is a no-brainer and I'm frankly surprised you can still purchase the outdated version of this board at almost double the price number 33 blee or Bluetooth low energy as the name suggests comes with Bluetooth and Bluetooth low energy as well as a 9-axis inertial sensor all you need for your DIY Fitbit Nano 33 ble sense adds a series of embedded sensors making it a perfect choice for AI focused projects such as offline voice recognition Nano 33 ilt and Nano rp2040 are both
(06:01) designed to empower internet of things and Cloud projects like home automation they also offer Advanced processes with embedded Wi-Fi and Bluetooth exactly one day after I completed this video earlier announced yet another new board so I had to go back to editing for you guys Nano esp32 Sports a microcontroller you would usually find in Arduino Alternatives like this little board over here although these boards were originally outside of the scope of this video esp32 and esp8266 Boards exist in many shapes and colors
(06:40) these boards are a perfect Arduino alternative if you want to get into internal of things projects as they offer both embedded Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at a very accessible price Arduino Empire or Arduino maker is the third common Arduino family it offers Advanced embedded hardware and a range of unusual connectivity Solutions aren't doing the maker Wi-Fi 1010 are essentially revisions one and two for the maker equivalent of Arduino Uno Wi-Fi and Arduino Nano iot perfect for Internet of Things projects Michael w a n 1300 and 1310 were made to
(07:24) use another fairly specialized feature Laura a proprietary radio communication technique maker Json 1400 offers GSM or simply put 3G connectivity for Internet of Things projects that cannot always rely on Wi-Fi Arduino maker and b1500 adds narrow band communication to your projects it can contact other devices over narrow band iot and LTM Networks an appropriate choice for remote areas finally Arduino maker 0 takes a different spin it is a development board for Music Makers as it allows you to play music from an SD card with no extra
(08:03) Hardware this concludes our brief overview of current Arduino development boards or so you would think if you did not spot a link to Arduino Pro website for professional industry Solutions gladly two out of four families offered by this web page are Nano and maker leaving us just two more categories to explore portend the H7 from portenta family comes in three industrial grade forms H7 H7 light and H7 light connected with identical size and pin position protectables are more or less a pro version of the maker board Arduino
(08:42) portenta is designed to offer a powerful and reliable family of solutions for large-scale complex projects like creating laboratory equipment or building high-end industrial machinery hence the dual core processor with a lot more memory and a significantly higher price portenta c33 offers the high performance of bartender boards at lower price and together with onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it offers a button solution for internet of things and connected systems if you need to manage a fleet of your Uber drivers over automate an
(09:18) assembly line a casual daily task for most of us I'm sure this board would be a perfect entry point pretend the X8 boosts pretend the family performance and price even higher with a dual core microcontroller for real-time operations and a dual core microprocessor that runs Linux microplatform OS this little board has autonomous guided Vehicles as a potential application listed on Arduino store can you imagine competing with Elon Musk from your garage Nikola family development boards are tiny low power tools for intelligent
(09:57) sensing Solutions Nicholas sense me offers a range of embedded environmental sensors motion air quality CO2 your name Nikola voice allows for easy implementation of always-on speech recognition on the edge all this mouthful essentially means offline voice recognition on a small microcontroller board finally niclet Vision does exactly what you'd expect from its name it features an onboard 2 megapixel color camera for all your image recognition needs this versatile low power small boards are made for developing and deploying
(10:35) Advanced machine learning solutions to reliably automate complex tasks when you go back to your massive Warehouse and that covers all the Arduino development board basics kind of you can still find some of the discontinued solutions that sometimes look nothing like an Arduino my favorites include Arduino Explorer which is essentially an Arduino Leonardo shaped like a Gamepad and lilypad a tiny board perfect for wearable projects in its 15 year history Fox at Arduino made a lot of different and creative development boards
(11:11) and that's it if you enjoyed this quick ish Arduino Board review do not like this video do not subscribe and do not share this video with your nerdy friend you will not get rid of them see ya
